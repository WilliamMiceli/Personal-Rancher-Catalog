# Redis

Redis is an open-source in-memory data structure project implementing a distributed, in-memory key-value database with optional durability. Redis supports different kinds of abstract data structures, such as strings, lists, maps, sets, sorted sets, hyperloglogs, bitmaps, streams and spatial indexes. The project is mainly developed by Salvatore Sanfilippo and is currently sponsored by Redis Labs.
