# httpd

### Status
Still container still does not like mounting httpd.conf for reasons I cannot seem to understand, whether it's by mounting the file directly, or the parent folder.
Getting the error message of it not being a regular file, along with "bad file descriptor".
Will eventually come back to this.

As for right now, it works **WITHOUT** persistent configuration
