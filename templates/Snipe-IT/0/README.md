# Snipe-IT

Snipe-IT was made for IT asset management, to enable IT departments to track who has which laptop, when it was purchased, which software licenses and accessories are available, and so on.

Snipe-IT is open source software. Transparency, security and oversight is at the heart of everything we do. No vendor lock-in again, ever.
