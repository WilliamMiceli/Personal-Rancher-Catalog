# WilliamMiceli's Personal Rancher Catalog

I like working on things that allow me to be more lazy.
More specifically, I didn't feel like typing in a whole bunch of stuff whenever I want to run something.

## My Own Setup

Quick Points:
- I'm using this all on my FreeNAS Server.
- Docker is running on RancherOS.
- No way am I paying for these volume services that charge crazy amounts when I have plenty of redundant storage locally.
  - Because of that, my templates are generally setup for local storage within the host OS (RancherOS) to mapped network shares.

## This Is Primarily For Me

I of course don't mind anyone else using this in their own Rancher setups, but I have a couple simple requests:
- Please don't start asking me to setup a whole bunch of other templates. You can absolutely suggest something cool, and if I like it, I might.
- If something breaks, absolutely feel free to let me know if I don't look like I'm already working on it, but there's no reason to get angry/emotional. You don't have any Service License Agreement with me, that's for sure. XP
- Please don't ask me to adjust templates for the many different ways that it could be setup. I'm going to set things up to work on my own systems, so if you need something for you, feel free to clone it and make your own needed changes.
